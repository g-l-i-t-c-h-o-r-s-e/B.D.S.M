# What Is it?
Because the Steam Workshop is wildly insecure and nobody cares about it and probably never will (gaben pls respond).
It Automates the process of locating, unpacking, finding luas throughout addons, opening the lua and manually checking the code.                                                                                                                                                
It also offers the option to backup the addon into a seperate folder for safe keeping and later dissection.

# What is that sketchy looking BD-Scan.exe for???
An awesome command line program I found for scanning folders for common malicious strings in glua; compiled by me. If you dont like it compile a binary of your own :b
