Back Door Scanner Mod - An Automated Garrys Mod Backdoor Scanner; for Windows


# What Is it?
Because the Steam Workshop is wildly insecure and nobody cares about it and probably never will (gaben pls respond).
It Automates the process of locating, unpacking, finding luas throughout addons, opening the lua and manually checking the code.                                                                                                                                                
It also offers the option to backup the addon into a seperate folder for safe keeping and later dissection.
