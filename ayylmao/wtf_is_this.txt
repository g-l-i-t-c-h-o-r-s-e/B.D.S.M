after years of academy training, hours and days of google searches payed off and I landed on this github page
https://github.com/ProtoGrace/Gmod-Backdoor-Scanner/tree/master/BD-Scan

I however compiled my own version instead of using the provided, because im that paranoid.
But thank G(mod)OD this exists.
